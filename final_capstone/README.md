<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/T31K/WWAWO/master/bowser.png" alt="bowser">

We're now entering Bowser's Castle to fight _the final boss_.
Well, perhaps it only makes sense for those of you old enough to remember this game (looking at you Gen-Zs....), this is _the final boss_.

We've finally reached here.
The Final Boss... The Final Capstone.

This is the time to flex your coding _skillz_.

### Instructions

For your final Capstone, you may choose to create any VueJS project.

The project can vary from a simple weather app to a complex crypto trading app, it's really your call.

However, as shown in the marking guide below, you are given 30 tasks in several domains.

For each task, you can earn maximum 3 points and minimum 0 point.
They are awarded based on how well you've executed each task.

**Score Guide**

| Non Existent | Poor | Average | Excellent |
| ------------ | ---- | ------- | --------- |
| 0            | 1    | 2       | 3         |

Since, `30 tasks * 3 points = 90 points`, we're missing 10 points to 100%.
The final 10 points will are aggregated from Capstone 1-5.

### Resources

Here are some list of projects that may inspire you.
