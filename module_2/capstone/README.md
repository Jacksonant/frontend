# ðŸ’Ž Capstone 2

Congrats on making it to the end of module 2.
Welcome to your second Capstone Project.

We will be creating a **portfolio site.**

Portfolio sites are a good way to showcase your skills to the world and especially potential employers. It also serves as a platform to exhibit the projects youâ€™ve built and of course the tech stack you work on.
<br/>

#### Instructions

1. Start with a index.html
2. Create `app.js` & `styles.css` and link them into index.html
3. Import TailwindCSS
4. You should have 5 `html` pages (`index.html` & 4 other pages)
5. `index.html` should be your home page that links well to the other 4 pages
6. `index.html` counts as 1 page
7. Do not be afraid to _copy_ code online. You are highly encouraged to do so. However, copying an **_entire_** template and just changing content is not.
   You may copy _snippets_ to assist you in achieving certain layouts/components you may want to build. Please also quote the source in the documentation.
8. Deploy your project into GitHub pages
9. Setup a `README.md`
