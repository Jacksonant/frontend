# Capstone 5

This is a big capstone project thatâ€™ll really test your abilities and find out whether or not youâ€™ve been paying attention ðŸ˜‰

In order to successfully score points, you need to use what youâ€™ve learnt so far in VueJS to create a PokÃ©dex app.

The API service we will be using is [https://pokeapi.co/](https://pokeapi.co/)
Take some time to read over the docs before we begin.

#### Instructions

1. Create a Vue application with the Vue CLI
2. Make an API call to pokeapi
3. With the returned results, add it into the `data()` of your app
4. Using a `v-for` , loop through the results and display the Pokemon
5. Style each card of Pokemon (TailwindCSS is optional)
6. Display all name, weight, height & all abilities/types for each Pokemon
