Welcome to Capstone 3.

This is a fun one, so let’s begin!

Different colours invoke different emotions in us, that’s why top companies spend resources and time to refine their colour schemes to tell their story.

In this capstone, will be creating a random colour scheme generator like colorhunt using the colorg API

This project will help you solidifying all the previous concepts of calling APIs, built a fun app without worrying too much about other topics in JavaScript and frontend

### Reference

colrorg API - [https://colr.org](https://colr.org)
colorhunt - [https://colorhunt.co/](https://colorhunt.co/)

1. Start with a index.html
2. Create `app.js` & `styles.css` and link them into index.html
3. Import TailwindCSS/Bootstrap/jQuery (optional)
4. We only need 1 page - `index.html`
5. Call the [https://colr.org/](https://colr.org/) API and get a random number scheme
6. Populate the results of random 7 colour schemes into small cards like colorhunt
7. Add `div` with the corresponding colours
8. You may choose to play around with the other endpoints to select tags/color name
9. Deploy your project into GitHub pages
10. Setup a `README.md`
