# Capstone 6

Time really flies and we're finally on our last Capstone. ðŸ˜­

It really isn't a coding course without creating a \*drumroll\* **To-Do List App**.

There's also a developer joke that says: every time you create a to-do list app, a puppy dies.

But rest assured, no puppies will be harmed in this Capstone.

No API service needed in this Capstone.
Just plain old Vue3, Pinia, mad coding _skillz_ & some patience.

### Instructions

1. Create a Vue application with the Vue CLI
2. Verify you have created a Vue3 application and installed Pinia
3. Create two components, `TodoControls.vue` and `TodoList.vue`
4. In your `App.vue`, import the previous two components you've created
5. As the name suggests:

- `TodoControls` should contain: input that accepts string and a button to add to-dos
- `TodoList` should contain: a list of to-dos

6. Create a store that uses `defineStore` from pinia
7. Your store should contain the following:

- `state`: a function that returns an array of to-do list items
- `getters`: a function that helps filter and display specific to-do- list items
- `actions`: contains functions that add/destroy/update the items in the to-do list
