# Capstone 4

Since we just dabbled a little on VueJS and the basics of it, let's put it to good use!

In this capstone, we will be building a foreign currency convert app.
We will be using the [exchangerate.host](https://exchangerate.host/#/#docs) API.

Take some time to read over the docs before we begin.

### Instructions

1. Create a VueJS application using the CLI
2. Create a two `<select>` input that both allows the user the select the foreign exchange pairing (eg. USD => SGD)
3. Create a text input to show the rates between two currencies
4. Call the API and apply the exchange rate
5. Allow the user to change the text input and calculate the exchange rate
6. Create a button to allow the user to swap the exchange rates (eg. USD => SGD swaps to SGD => USD)
